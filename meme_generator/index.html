      <h1>How to Play</h1>
      <p> This game requires you to talk using memes! At their root, memes are cultural ideas, actions, or mannerisms that are 
        passed on with the hope of spreading. You must actively steer the direction that these memes take in our culture by posting your own! Using the Glorious Trainwrecks forum as a site, you will post memes, 
        comment on them when deciding if they are interesting, and post your own in response! We have inspiration images as
        starting points for the image that you will post.</p>
      
      <p> Use <a href=https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/99260282/Drag-and-drop> this </a> meme generator to make a meme. 
        Be creative and have fun, but don't be an asshole </p>
      
      <p>share the image via a forum post!</p>
      
      <p>after you get your meme add a new comment.</p>
      <p>Then reply to a comment you haven’t commented on.</p>
      <p>Then reply to a comment you’ve already commented on</p>
