meme-Chain
The generator for a game that requires players to communicate with memes!
This game has players post memes on forums in response to those of other players while creating an original one of their own. Players gain points for contributing to other chains, but get even more when their own chains are contributed to, encouraging players to support chains that haven't been developed so as not to lose to another chain. The goal for this game was to explore how cultural ideas compete and collaborate simultaniously, and how individuals guide these interactions.
